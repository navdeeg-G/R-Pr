# Data Munging

- Data munging is the process of cleaning data and or conducting feature engineering (making new variables out of current variables in a dataset).
- This repo contains scripts that support data munging.
- These scripts apply to data cleaning/munging & feature engineering for applications in machine learning. They serve as a means to explore and cleanup data as to avoid the "garbage in, garbage out" phenomenon that is heard around the ML world.
- In addition, I hope they serve as a means to discovery patterns in the data before an algorithm is implemented as feature engineering and data exploration are just as or even more important than using an algorithm out of the box.
