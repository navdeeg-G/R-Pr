# R-Programming

UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

The purpose of this repo is to show some programming exercises I have done in R. Most of these exercises are typical programming ones many would expect along with some unique
to R. 

File format so far is as follows:

Each "Assignment_" folder containts a .pdf file that displays the problems I was trying to solve in R. The corresponding R code is in the .R file. Also, there are .pdf/.html reports available that show what the code outputs without actually running it.
