# R-Programming Review

  - This folder contains information about R as a programming language along with the quirks R has going for itself. 
  - Each script acts as a topic of the R programming languge. For example, DataFrames.R goes over how data frames work in R.
      - Note: I would not say this repo is complete, but it does                  cover a decent amount. I try to add to this              repo as much as possible.
